This repository includes all code written for our capstone project, "Machine Learning for Image Recognition Purposes".

All the trained models have been included in this repository and can be used to evaluate accuracy or can be used in the
GUI. However, the training logs are large files, and hence have been excluded. The models will need to be retrained in
order to use the functions that plot the training graphs.

The training logs for our three best performing models have been included on the USB drive submitted with our report.

Additionally the digits we collected at Endeavour 2017 have been included on the USB drive only.
